# Open-Source-Navigation
This Application can give your current location when you are in need.
The Application is Integrated with open-source - OpenStreetMap which is accessed in tiled format without any need for GIS tools or knowledge.
The above is made possible by the open-source JS library leaflet.
I have also Integrated open-source Nasa Earth Data Token for Satellite Imagery.
I have used OpenCageData api for Latitude and Longitude to Address Conversion and Vice Versa.
Using This Application client can get the approximate(Almost Precise) distance between 2 locations on the map.
I have used Markers in the Map to mark your current Location or the other 2 address that you want to find.
I have also included Navigation Feature that marks a path between 2 locations that you gave as input.
